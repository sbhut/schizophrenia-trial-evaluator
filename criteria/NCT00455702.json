The study will also examine the effects of 50mg d-cycloserine on positive symptoms and negative symptoms, as well as assess tolerability and side-effects.","detailedDescription":"This is a ten-week, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial examining the cognitive effects at weeks 1, 2, 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \\& 10 of once-weekly oral D-cycloserine 50 mg added to a stable dose of antipsychotic for 8 weeks in 60 adult outpatients with schizophrenia.\n\nSpecific aims:\n\n1. Assess the effects of a single dose of D-cycloserine 50 mg on cognitive functioning compared to placebo.\n2. Assess the effects of repeated weekly dosing of D-cycloserine on cognitive functioning at week 8 compared to placebo.\n3. Assess the effects of repeated weekly dosing of D-cycloserine on memory functioning once a week 1 hour after medication administration compared to placebo.\n4. Assess the persistence of learned information in a no-treatment follow-up assessment at Week 10 in the D-cycloserine group compared to the placebo group.\n5. Assess effects of weekly D-cycloserine dosing on positive \\& negative symptoms at week 8 compared to placebo.\n6. Assess tolerability and side effects of weekly D-cycloserine compared to placebo.\n7. Assess the effects of d-cycloserine dosed weekly for seven weeks on reward responsiveness as measured with the response bias task compared with placebo.\n8. Assess the effects of d-cycloserine dosed weekly for seven weeks on measures of functioning."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Schizophrenia"],"keywords":["schizophrenia","cognition","d-cycloserine","memory"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":38,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"D-cycloserine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"50 mg d-cycloserine","interventionNames":["Drug: d-cycloserine"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"50 mg placebo","interventionNames":["Drug: d-cycloserine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"d-cycloserine","description":"50mg dose d-cycloserine v placebo","armGroupLabels":["D-cycloserine","Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Main Outcome Measure: The Change From Baseline to Week 8 on the SANS","description":"The change from baseline to week 8 on the scale for the assessment of negative symptoms (SANS) total score.
