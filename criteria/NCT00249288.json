The specific aims of this study are:\n\n* To examine factors potentially contributing to differences in blood folate, homocysteine or B12 levels between patients at baseline, including dietary intake and cigarette smoking.\n* To test the hypothesis that low folate is associated with negative symptoms by examining correlations between red blood cell folate concentrations and clinical ratings of negative symptoms and by comparing folate concentrations in deficit syndrome versus non-deficit syndrome patients. We will also control for dietary intake cigarettes smoking, gender, and age.\n* To examine the efficacy of folate supplementation for reducing negative symptoms"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Schizophrenia"],"keywords":["Schizophrenia","Negative Symptoms","Folate"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":46,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Folate","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive a 2 mg/ day dose of folate, for 12 weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: Folate"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive a 2 mg/ day dose of placebo, for 12 weeks","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Folate","description":"Folic acid taken as 2, 1mg capsule daily for 12 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Folate"],"otherNames":["Folate or folic acid"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Placebo taken as 2, 1mg capsule daily for 12 weeks","armGroupLabels":["Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Correlation Between Baseline Blood Folate and Smoking Status","description":"Baseline blood folate lab levels are reported by smoking status.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Correlation Between Baseline Blood Folate and MTHFR Genotype","description":"Baseline blood folate lab levels are reported by MTHFR genotype.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Correlation Between Baseline Blood Folate Levels and Dietary Intake","description":"Baseline blood folate lab levels and dietary intake levels are reported.","timeFrame":"Baseline"},{"measure":"Efficacy of Folate Supplementation for Reducing Negative Symptoms as Measured by the SANS Modified Total","description":"The change from baseline to week 12 on the scale for the assessment of negative symptoms (SANS) modified total score.
