19706200,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history, past medical history, and discharge diagnosis do not mention any seizure disorder. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, PTSD, and ADD, but there is no evidence or documentation of seizures or a seizure disorder in the provided data. Medications such as Klonopin (clonazepam) are sometimes used for seizure disorders, but in this case, they are prescribed for other indications (e.g., anxiety or bipolar disorder), as indicated by the patient's clinical context. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for a seizure disorder."
19700168,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history includes schizophrenia, CKD, hypertension, and other conditions, but there is no mention of a seizure disorder or any related symptoms, medications (e.g., antiepileptics), or clinical notes indicating seizures in the provided data."
10884708,Seizure disorder,No,"There is no mention of any seizure disorder, epilepsy, or seizures in any of the patient's medical records provided. The patient has a history of metastatic breast cancer, heart failure, and paranoid schizophrenia, but no documentation of seizures or related treatments."
15112182,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history includes conditions such as DM2, HTN, HLD, and a history of polio, but there is no mention of a seizure disorder in the Past Medical History or any other section. The patient is on medications like Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) and Divalproex (Depakote), which are sometimes used for seizure disorders, but in this context, they are being used as mood stabilizers for schizoaffective disorder, as indicated in the clinical notes. There are no documented episodes of seizures or a diagnosis of epilepsy or any other seizure disorder. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for a seizure disorder."
16548967,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical records include multiple admissions and detailed clinical notes, but there is no mention of a seizure disorder. The EEG performed during one admission showed slowing consistent with encephalopathy but no epileptiform activity. Additionally, the patient's medications do not include any antiepileptic drugs typically used for seizure management (e.g., levetiracetam, phenytoin). The absence of documented seizures or related treatments supports the conclusion that the patient does not meet this criterion."
18581630,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history includes schizophrenia, tardive dyskinesia, and prior adenomatous polyps, but there is no mention of a seizure disorder in any of the provided clinical notes, past medical history, or discharge diagnoses. The patient is on lamotrigine, which is used for bipolar disorder and epilepsy, but in this context, it is prescribed for schizophrenia (as indicated in the clinical notes). There are no documented seizures, epilepsy, or related symptoms in the patient's history or current presentation. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for a seizure disorder."
18709925,Seizure disorder,No,"There is no mention of a seizure disorder in any of the patient's medical records provided. The patient has a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, and diabetes, but no documented seizures or antiepileptic medications. The absence of any reference to seizures or related treatments in the clinical notes, medications, or discharge diagnoses supports the conclusion that the patient does not meet this exclusion criterion."
14222176,Seizure disorder,Yes,"The patient's medical history includes a documented seizure disorder, as noted in the discharge diagnosis from the admission on 2190-08-01: ""Secondary Diagnoses: 1. h/o cocaine-induced MI, 2. Seizure disorder, 3. DM2, 4. Paranoid schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder."" Additionally, during the same admission, the patient reported a recent seizure several days prior to presentation, and his Depakote level was subtherapeutic, further supporting the diagnosis of a seizure disorder. This is consistent across multiple encounters, confirming the presence of a seizure disorder as part of the patient's medical history."

Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for seizure disorder."
14560913,Seizure disorder,No,"There is no documentation in the patient's records indicating a history of seizures or seizure disorder. The patient has a history of schizoaffective disorder, AML, and other medical conditions, but no mention of seizures or antiepileptic medications (other than Depakote, which was used for mood stabilization, not seizures). The non-convulsive status epilepticus noted during her final hospitalization was an acute event likely secondary to her terminal condition (relapsed AML and sepsis) and not indicative of a chronic seizure disorder."
19014146,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history, including past psychiatric history, physical exam, and discharge diagnosis, does not mention any seizure disorder or related symptoms (e.g., seizures, epilepsy, or anticonvulsant medications). The neurological exam was normal, and there is no evidence of seizure activity in the clinical notes. The medications listed (e.g., antipsychotics, anxiolytics) are not typically used for seizure management. Therefore, the patient does not meet this exclusion criterion."
19076317,Seizure disorder,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of epilepsy secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis with recurrent multifocal hemorrhages. The clinical notes describe multiple breakthrough seizures, including detailed seizure semiology (e.g., left head turn, left eye deviation, and behavioral arrest). EEG findings confirm electrographic seizures originating from the right hemisphere. The patient is on multiple antiepileptic medications (e.g., levetiracetam, lamotrigine, zonisamide, and lacosamide), further supporting the diagnosis of a seizure disorder. The discharge diagnosis also explicitly lists ""#Seizures."" Thus, the patient clearly meets the criterion for a seizure disorder."
15773641,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history includes schizophrenia and recurrent foreign body ingestion, but there is no mention of a seizure disorder in the provided data. The patient's medications (e.g., Haloperidol, Benztropine, Mirtazapine) are consistent with treatment for schizophrenia and related symptoms, not for a seizure disorder. No clinical notes, lab results, or imaging findings suggest a history of seizures or epilepsy. Therefore, the patient does not meet the exclusion criterion for a seizure disorder."

There is no evidence of seizures or related symptoms in the provided data."
18213938,Seizure disorder,Yes,"The patient's past medical history includes ""history of stress-related seizures,"" which indicates a seizure disorder. This meets the exclusion criterion for seizure disorder."
11248130,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history and clinical notes do not mention any history of seizures or seizure disorder. The patient's neurological exams are documented as normal, and there are no references to seizures, epilepsy, or anticonvulsant medications (other than Depakote, which is used here for bipolar disorder). The ""twitching"" noted is described as mild and related to medication side effects or baseline movements, not indicative of a seizure disorder."
16355814,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history, physical exam, and clinical notes do not mention any history of seizures or seizure disorder. The patient's past medical history only includes asthma, and there are no medications, lab results, or documented symptoms suggestive of a seizure disorder. The neurological exam was normal without any abnormalities that would indicate a seizure disorder."
16393838,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history, physical exam, and clinical notes do not mention any history of seizures or seizure disorder. The neurological exam was normal, and there is no evidence of past or current seizure activity or treatment for seizures. The patient denied any previous medical diagnoses or treatments, further supporting the absence of a seizure disorder."
13899324,Seizure disorder,Yes,"The patient's medical history explicitly includes ""Seizure Disorder vs Pseudoseizures,"" and there are documented episodes of seizure-like activity (e.g., blank staring, tongue clicking) during the hospital stay. Additionally, the patient is prescribed phenytoin, an antiepileptic medication, both on admission and at discharge, further supporting the diagnosis of a seizure disorder. Neurology was consulted and recommended continuing phenytoin, indicating clinical concern for seizures. Thus, the patient meets the exclusion criterion for seizure disorder."
12940117,Seizure disorder,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of seizure disorder, including witnessed grand mal, tonic-clonic seizures, and episodes of LOC with limb shaking. She has been treated with multiple AEDs (e.g., Depakote, phenytoin, phenobarbital) and has had abnormal EEG findings consistent with epilepsy. Clinical notes repeatedly reference her seizure disorder, including recent seizures during hospitalization due to noncompliance with Depakote. Neurology consultations and imaging (e.g., MRI, CT) further support the diagnosis. Thus, the patient unequivocally meets this exclusion criterion."
11331027,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history includes psychiatric conditions such as bipolar disorder, PTSD, and schizophrenia, as well as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema. There is no mention of a seizure disorder in the past medical history, current medications, or clinical notes. The medications listed (e.g., lithium, Depakote, Haldol) are primarily for psychiatric management and not for seizure control. Therefore, the patient does not meet the exclusion criterion for seizure disorder."
18144278,Seizure disorder,Yes,"The patient has a well-documented history of drug-resistant primary generalized epilepsy since childhood, with recurrent generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic jerks, and episodes of unresponsiveness. Multiple EEGs have confirmed generalized seizure activity, and the patient has been on various antiepileptic drugs (e.g., lamotrigine, zonisamide, brivaracetam) with poor seizure control. Clinical notes consistently describe seizure types, precipitants, and treatment adjustments, confirming an active seizure disorder."
12892024,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical records include multiple admissions and detailed past medical history, which lists conditions such as HCV cirrhosis, polysubstance abuse, GERD, depression, anxiety, schizoaffective disorder, and PTSD. There is no mention of a seizure disorder in any of the provided clinical notes, history, or medications (e.g., no antiepileptic drugs are prescribed). Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for a seizure disorder."
15876666,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical records do not mention a history of seizures or epilepsy. The patient has a history of paranoid schizophrenia, asthma, recurrent pneumonia, and other conditions, but there is no documented evidence of seizure disorder or use of antiepileptic medications (other than divalproex, which is used here for psychiatric management). Thus, the patient does not meet the exclusion criterion for seizure disorder."
15725940,Seizure disorder,Yes,"The patient's past medical history includes ""possible seizure disorder,"" and the EEG results show abnormalities such as left anterior quadrant slowing and focal sharp waves in the left temporal region, which raise the possibility of focal epileptogenesis. Additionally, the patient is prescribed Trileptal (oxcarbazepine), an antiepileptic medication, which is increased at discharge to a dose that could prevent seizures. These findings and treatments strongly suggest the presence of a seizure disorder."
18321272,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history includes schizophrenia, lung cancer, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism, but there is no mention of a seizure disorder in any of the provided clinical notes. The patient is on medications like Clozapine and Depakote, which are sometimes used for seizure disorders, but in this context, they are clearly prescribed for psychiatric conditions (schizophrenia and mood stabilization). No documented history of seizures or epilepsy is noted."
19308216,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history and clinical notes do not mention any diagnosis of a seizure disorder. The patient has a history of HIV/AIDS, T2DM, HTN, depression/anxiety, and mild cognitive impairment, but there is no documentation of seizures, epilepsy, or any related symptoms or treatments (e.g., antiepileptic medications). Therefore, the patient does not meet this exclusion criterion."
15881594,Seizure disorder,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of a presumptive seizure disorder, including a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure with elevated prolactin levels, and has been on antiepileptic medications (Keppra and transitioning to Lamictal). Although EEG monitoring during hospitalization did not capture electrographic seizures, the clinical history and treatment regimen support the diagnosis of a seizure disorder. The discharge diagnosis of ""Dyscognitive spells"" does not negate the established history of seizures."
13949181,Seizure disorder,No,"There is no mention of a seizure disorder in any of the patient's medical records provided. The patient has a history of schizophrenia, poorly controlled diabetes, chronic scalp wound, and chronic diarrhea, but no documented history of seizures or epilepsy. Medications such as Divalproex (Depakote) are used for mood stabilization in schizophrenia and not specifically for seizure disorder in this context. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for a seizure disorder."
16363952,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history and clinical notes do not mention a seizure disorder. The patient is on Depakote (divalproex), which is commonly used for mood stabilization in psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as for seizure disorders. However, the notes indicate the Depakote was titrated for behavioral control and hypomanic features, not for seizure management. There is no documentation of seizures, epilepsy, or related symptoms in the history, physical exam, or discharge diagnosis. Thus, the patient does not meet the criterion for a seizure disorder."
14140685,Seizure disorder,No,"There is no mention of a seizure disorder in the patient's past medical history, current medications, or clinical notes. The patient has a history of schizoaffective disorder, hypothyroidism, and other conditions, but no evidence of seizures or epilepsy is documented. Therefore, the patient does not meet this exclusion criterion."
10649223,Seizure disorder,No,"There is no mention of a seizure disorder in the patient's medical history, past psychiatric history, or current medications. The patient is on Depakote (divalproex), which is also used for mood stabilization in schizophrenia, and there is no indication it is prescribed for seizure control.

14513439,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical records include a history of psychiatric conditions (e.g., schizoaffective disorder, borderline personality disorder) and chronic pain, but there is no mention of a seizure disorder. The patient has been prescribed medications like gabapentin and lamotrigine, which are sometimes used for seizure disorders, but these are also commonly prescribed for chronic pain and mood stabilization in psychiatric conditions. There is no documentation of seizures, epilepsy, or related symptoms in the clinical notes. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for a seizure disorder."
18055599,Seizure disorder,Not Enough Information,"The patient's medical history includes a mention of a ""distant history of seizures"" in one admission note (2170-08-06), but there is no further documentation or confirmation of an active seizure disorder, current treatment for seizures, or recent episodes. The patient is on medications like clonazepam and divalproex, which can be used for seizure disorders but are also commonly prescribed for bipolar disorder and anxiety in this patient. Without explicit confirmation of an active seizure disorder, the information is insufficient to definitively conclude that the patient meets this criterion."
16387211,Seizure disorder,Yes,"The patient's past medical history includes ""TLE (Most Recent Sz ___ years ago)"" (Temporal Lobe Epilepsy with a most recent seizure some years ago). Additionally, during a hospital admission, the patient was noted to have lethargy thought to be from seizures, leading to a Neurology consultation and initiation of Keppra (levetiracetam), an antiepileptic medication. These findings confirm the presence of a seizure disorder."
12489425,Seizure disorder,No,"There is no mention of a seizure disorder in any of the patient's medical records provided. The patient has a history of schizoaffective disorder, hypertension, anemia, and other conditions, but no documented seizures or related treatments. The neurological reviews and history do not indicate any seizure activity or diagnosis."

The patient's medications (Clonazepam, Risperidone, Multivitamins) are not indicative of seizure disorder management, as Clonazepam in this context is likely prescribed for anxiety or agitation related to schizoaffective disorder. There is no evidence in the clinical notes, lab results, or physical exam findings to suggest a seizure disorder."
14952802,Seizure disorder,No,"There is no mention of a seizure disorder in any of the patient's medical records, including past medical history, medications (no antiepileptic drugs), or clinical notes. The patient has a history of schizophrenia, multiple myeloma, diabetes, and renal failure, but no documented seizures or related symptoms."
12056267,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history, past psychiatric history, and discharge diagnosis do not mention any seizure disorder or epilepsy. The medications listed (e.g., risperidone, perphenazine, fluoxetine) are primarily for schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions, with no antiepileptic drugs noted. The neurological exam was also unremarkable, with no mention of seizures or related symptoms. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest the patient meets this exclusion criterion."
11402251,Seizure disorder,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of alcohol withdrawal seizures, as noted in multiple admissions (e.g., ""history of alcohol withdrawal seizures"" and ""reports history of seizure several months ago, in the setting of EtOH use""). This confirms an active seizure disorder related to alcohol withdrawal, which meets the exclusion criterion for seizure disorder."
13283535,Seizure disorder,No,"The patient's medical history includes hypothyroid, depression/anxiety, schizoaffective disorder, and other conditions, but there is no mention of a seizure disorder in any of the provided clinical notes, past medical history, or medications (e.g., no antiepileptic drugs like phenytoin, valproate, etc.).
