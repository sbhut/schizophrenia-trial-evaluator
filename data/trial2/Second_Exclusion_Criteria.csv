19706200,Dementia,No,"The patient's cognitive assessment indicates alertness, orientation x3, correct attention (MOYB), and intact memory (recall at 5 minutes with 1 clue). While the patient exhibits disorganized thought form and tangential thinking, these are more consistent with her diagnosed bipolar affective disorder with psychotic features rather than dementia. There is no evidence of progressive cognitive decline or memory impairment characteristic of dementia."
19700168,Dementia,Not Enough Information,"The patient's records include concerns about cognitive impairment, such as difficulty with short-term memory and word-finding difficulties noted during psychiatric hospitalization. However, there is no formal diagnosis of dementia documented. The patient declined further neuropsychological testing, and the clinical notes suggest monitoring rather than confirming dementia. Thus, while there are indicators of possible cognitive decline, the data is insufficient to confirm a dementia diagnosis."
10884708,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a history of paranoid schizophrenia and episodes of agitation or altered mental status, but there is no documented diagnosis of dementia. The patient has been evaluated for capacity during hospitalizations and was found to have capacity to make medical decisions. The episodes of confusion or agitation appear to be related to her psychiatric condition, medication side effects, or metabolic derangements rather than a progressive cognitive decline characteristic of dementia. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
15112182,Dementia,No,"The patient's neuropsychiatric examination and cognitive assessments indicate intact attention, orientation, memory, and fund of knowledge. There is no evidence of cognitive decline or impairment consistent with dementia. The patient's disorganization and behavioral issues are attributed to schizoaffective disorder and OCD, not dementia."
16548967,Dementia,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of ""dementia, presumed dementia pugilistica"" in multiple admissions (e.g., 2186-10-04, 2186-07-20, 2185-01-23). This is attributed to a history of repeated head trauma from boxing. Clinical notes describe cognitive impairment, frontal release signs, and progressive functional decline, consistent with dementia. The diagnosis is further supported by neuroimaging (MRI showing generalized volume loss) and EEG findings (slowing consistent with encephalopathy). Thus, the patient meets the criterion for dementia."
18581630,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical history includes paranoid schizophrenia and tardive dyskinesia, but there is no mention of dementia in any of the clinical notes, discharge summaries, or past medical history. The patient's mental status is documented as ""clear and coherent"" or ""confused - sometimes,"" which is more consistent with his underlying schizophrenia rather than dementia. Additionally, there are no cognitive assessments or diagnostic evaluations suggestive of dementia in the provided data."
18709925,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records do not mention any diagnosis or symptoms of dementia. The patient has a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression with catatonia, and episodes of agitation, but these conditions are distinct from dementia. The patient's mental status is documented as ""clear and coherent"" and ""alert and interactive"" upon discharge, which does not support a diagnosis of dementia. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
14222176,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a history of chronic paranoid schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, but there is no documentation or clinical evidence suggesting dementia. The patient's cognitive exam findings, such as being alert and oriented, with grossly intact memory/registration/recall/attention, do not support a diagnosis of dementia. The patient's disorganization and paranoia are attributed to his primary psychiatric conditions rather than a neurodegenerative process."
11197450,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes and discharge diagnoses indicate a history of schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder, not dementia. The patient exhibits symptoms of psychosis, including delusions and paranoia, but there is no evidence of cognitive decline, memory impairment, or other hallmarks of dementia. The mental status exams and collateral information focus on psychotic symptoms rather than neurodegenerative or cognitive deficits. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
13909531,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes and cognitive assessments do not indicate any signs of dementia. The patient has a history of psychotic disorders (brief psychotic disorder, unspecified psychotic disorder, and schizophrenia) and exhibits symptoms such as paranoia, auditory hallucinations, and disorganized behavior, but these are consistent with his primary psychiatric diagnoses. Cognitive exams show intact memory, orientation, and fund of knowledge, with no evidence of progressive cognitive decline or impairment typical of dementia. The patient's issues are better explained by his psychotic disorders and substance use (alcohol) rather than a neurodegenerative condition like dementia."
16093686,Dementia,No,"The patient's neurological exam indicates they are ""alert and oriented x 3"" with ""normal attention"" and intact cognitive functions (CN II-XII intact). There is no mention of memory impairment, cognitive decline, or other symptoms suggestive of dementia in the history, physical exam, or clinical notes. The patient's psychiatric history includes depression and polysubstance abuse, but these are not indicative of dementia. The discharge condition also notes the patient was ""clear and coherent"" with no signs of cognitive dysfunction. Thus, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
11298819,Dementia,No,"The patient has a documented history of schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder, but there is no evidence of dementia in the clinical notes. The patient's mental status is repeatedly described as ""alert and oriented"" or ""clear and coherent,"" and while there are instances of confusion or cognitive dulling, these are attributed to psychiatric conditions, medications, or acute medical issues (e.g., sepsis). A psychiatry consult even recommended neurocognitive testing to rule out dementia, but no diagnosis of dementia is confirmed in the records. Thus, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
15150123,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a history of bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder, but there is no mention of dementia. The patient's mental status is consistently documented as clear and coherent, alert, and interactive during admissions and discharges. There are no clinical notes, lab results, or imaging findings suggestive of dementia. The patient's cognitive function appears intact, and there is no evidence of memory impairment or other symptoms consistent with dementia."
16191898,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder and tardive dystonia, but there is no mention of dementia. The patient's cognitive function appears intact, as evidenced by her ability to articulate her symptoms, engage in groups, and plan for discharge. Additionally, the use of donepezil (Aricept) is noted, which is typically prescribed for dementia, but in this context, it is being used to address tardive dystonia, not cognitive decline. There is no clinical documentation of memory loss, cognitive impairment, or other symptoms consistent with dementia."
13631551,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes and mental status exam do not indicate any signs of dementia. The patient is alert and oriented x3, with no documented memory deficits (though memory assessment was deferred due to perseveration on delusions). The primary diagnoses are Paranoid Schizophrenia and BPAD (Bipolar Affective Disorder), with symptoms such as delusions, labile affect, and disorganized thought processes, which are not consistent with dementia. Cognitive assessment (fund of knowledge, attention) was either average or deferred due to psychiatric symptoms, not cognitive decline. No history of head trauma, seizures, or neurologic illness was noted that would suggest dementia."
19903733,Dementia,No,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a psychotic episode, including paranoia, bizarre behavior, and disorganized thinking, but there is no evidence of progressive cognitive decline or memory impairment characteristic of dementia. The patient's cognitive assessment, though limited, showed orientation to person and place, with only mild disorientation to time, which is more likely due to his acute psychiatric condition rather than dementia. The discharge diagnosis of Psychosis NOS, r/o schizophrenia v. schizoaffective disorder v. substance-induced mood disorder further supports that the primary issue is not dementia."
12052932,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a history of chronic paranoid schizophrenia with active psychotic symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations, but there is no mention of cognitive decline, memory impairment, or other symptoms consistent with dementia. The patient's mental status exams describe tangential thought processes and delusional thinking, which are more characteristic of schizophrenia rather than dementia. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
17894568,Dementia,Yes,"The patient has a history of cognitive impairment, with a recent MoCA score of 23, which is below the normal threshold (typically <26 suggests cognitive impairment). Additionally, the clinical notes mention ""beginning stages of a chronic dementing process (eg vascular dementia)"" and a family history of Alzheimer's in the mother. The patient's behavior, including confusion, agitation, and delusions, further supports the presence of dementia, likely vascular dementia given her history of CAD, HTN, and diabetes."
14560913,Dementia,No,"Throughout the patient's medical records, there is no documented evidence of dementia. The patient has a well-documented history of schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia, which are distinct from dementia. Cognitive assessments during admissions note orientation, intact memory, and no deficits suggestive of dementia. The patient's disorganized behavior and psychotic symptoms are consistent with their primary psychiatric diagnoses rather than a neurodegenerative process like dementia."
19014146,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes and history indicate a diagnosis of schizophrenia, PTSD, and depression, with symptoms including disorganized thought processes, paranoia, and suicidal/homicidal ideation. However, there is no mention of memory impairment, cognitive decline, or other hallmark features of dementia. The patient's cognition was assessed with intact attention, orientation, and executive function, and while there were some memory recall issues, these were not consistent with a dementia diagnosis. The primary psychiatric conditions and symptoms described do not align with the diagnostic criteria for dementia."
19076317,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate episodes of inattentiveness and difficulty following commands, which were attributed to a language barrier and medication side effects (e.g., Propranolol contributing to lethargy). There is no documented evidence of progressive cognitive decline, memory impairment, or other hallmark features of dementia. The patient's mental status improved with medication adjustments, and she was consistently described as alert and oriented during examinations. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
15773641,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a diagnosis of schizophrenia with command auditory hallucinations, but there is no mention of dementia. The patient's cognitive issues, such as being a ""poor historian,"" are more consistent with schizophrenia rather than dementia. Additionally, the discharge notes describe the patient as ""clear and coherent"" with no evidence of memory impairment or cognitive decline typical of dementia. Therefore, the patient does not meet the exclusion criterion for dementia."
14242004,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes and neuropsychiatric examination do not indicate any signs of dementia. The patient is oriented to self, location, and date, and demonstrates intact memory, abstraction, calculation, and fund of knowledge. The primary diagnoses are Bipolar Affective Disorder with psychotic features and a history of schizoaffective disorder, which are distinct from dementia. There is no evidence of progressive cognitive decline or memory impairment characteristic of dementia."
18213938,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records and clinical notes do not mention any symptoms, diagnoses, or treatments related to dementia. The patient's mental status is documented as ""Clear and coherent"" on discharge, and there is no evidence of cognitive impairment or memory issues in the history, physical exam, or discharge condition. Therefore, the patient does not meet the exclusion criterion for dementia."
11248130,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes indicate a diagnosis of schizophrenia, paranoid type, with symptoms including auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and disorganized thought processes. There is no mention of memory impairment, cognitive decline, or other features consistent with dementia. The patient's cognitive exam shows intact orientation, attention, memory, and language, further supporting the absence of dementia."
16355814,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes and cognitive assessment do not indicate any signs of dementia. The patient's thought process is described as linear and goal-directed, and there is no mention of memory impairment or cognitive decline typical of dementia. The primary diagnosis is schizophrenia, paranoid type, which does not inherently include dementia. The cognitive assessment shows intact attention, memory, and other cognitive functions, further supporting the absence of dementia."
16393838,Dementia,No,"The patient's cognitive function was assessed during the physical exam and mental status evaluations. The patient was oriented to person, time, place, and situation, with intact memory for recent and past events, normal attention, and no evidence of cognitive decline. The discharge summary also notes that the patient's cognition was intact, with no signs of dementia. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
13899324,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and borderline personality disorder, but there is no mention of dementia. The patient's cognitive impairments, such as disorganized thoughts and paranoia, are consistent with her psychiatric conditions rather than dementia. Additionally, her discharge condition notes she is ""alert, oriented, and ambulatory,"" which further supports the absence of dementia."
12940117,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes and evaluations consistently describe symptoms and behaviors consistent with chronic paranoid schizophrenia, including delusions of thought insertion, persecution, and poor insight/judgment. There is no mention of cognitive decline, memory impairment, or other hallmarks of dementia. The patient's cognitive exam results (orientation, memory, attention, etc.) are noted to be intact, and her presentation is better explained by her primary psychiatric condition. Additionally, while her mother had vascular dementia, there is no evidence to suggest the patient herself has dementia. Thus, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
11331027,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes indicate a history of psychotic disorder NOS, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and borderline mental retardation/developmental delay, but there is no mention of dementia. The patient's cognitive function is described as ""alert and oriented, no deficits in attention, answers questions appropriately,"" which does not align with the typical presentation of dementia. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
18144278,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a history of memory loss and cognitive difficulties, which are attributed to his epilepsy, depression with psychotic features, and possibly past ECT treatment. However, there is no documentation of a formal diagnosis of dementia. The patient's cognitive issues appear to be episodic and related to his psychiatric and neurological conditions rather than a progressive neurodegenerative disorder like dementia. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."

The patient's cognitive issues, such as confusion and paranoia, are attributed to his schizophrenia and hypercalcemia episodes, not dementia. The clinical notes consistently describe the patient as alert and oriented when not affected by acute metabolic disturbances or psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
12056267,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes and mental status examination do not indicate any signs or symptoms of dementia. The patient has a diagnosis of schizophrenia, paranoid type, with symptoms such as disorganized thought, visual hallucinations, and homicidal ideation, which are consistent with schizophrenia rather than dementia. The cognitive exam, though limited due to the patient falling asleep, did not reveal deficits typical of dementia (e.g., memory loss, cognitive decline). The patient's thought process was noted to be linear and organized upon discharge, further supporting the absence of dementia."
11402251,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate episodes of altered mental status, confusion, and hallucinations, but these are consistently attributed to acute conditions such as alcohol intoxication, withdrawal, or polysubstance abuse rather than a chronic neurodegenerative process like dementia. There is no documentation of progressive cognitive decline, memory impairment, or other hallmark features of dementia. The patient's mental status improves with treatment of the underlying acute conditions, further supporting that dementia is not present."
13283535,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a history of schizoaffective disorder with psychotic features, including auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions, but there is no mention of cognitive decline, memory impairment, or other symptoms consistent with dementia. The patient's mental status exams consistently note that she is alert, oriented, and cognitively intact, with no evidence of dementia. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
19082488,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes indicate a history of paranoid schizophrenia and an acute psychotic episode, but there is no mention of cognitive decline, memory impairment, or other symptoms consistent with dementia. The patient's thought process was tangential and she exhibited poor insight/judgment, which are more characteristic of her psychotic disorder rather than dementia. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
15040139,Dementia,No,"The patient's records indicate a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder and episodes of confusion, but these are attributed to lithium intoxication and medication non-adherence rather than a progressive neurodegenerative condition like dementia. The patient's cognitive impairments (e.g., poor attention, inability to recall details) are context-specific (e.g., during lithium toxicity) and improve with treatment. There is no evidence of persistent or progressive cognitive decline characteristic of dementia. The patient's baseline mental status exams during stable periods (e.g., ""alert, oriented x3"") further support the absence of dementia."
16914402,Dementia,No,"The patient has a history of schizoaffective disorder and episodes of altered mental status due to hyponatremia and non-convulsive status epilepticus, but there is no documented evidence of progressive cognitive decline or dementia. The episodes of confusion were reversible and tied to specific medical conditions (e.g., hyponatremia, seizures) or medications (e.g., lithium, clozapine). The patient's mental status returned to baseline after treatment, and there are no chronic deficits suggestive of dementia."
13333091,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical history includes chronic schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder, but there is no mention of dementia. The discharge notes indicate the patient was ""A&Ox2-3"" (alert and oriented to 2-3 spheres) and sometimes confused, which could be attributed to her psychiatric conditions, medications, or post-operative state rather than dementia. No clinical documentation or diagnosis of dementia is present in the provided data."
17816095,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and a history of psychiatric hospitalizations related to psychosis and medication noncompliance. The cognitive examination during admission and discharge shows intact orientation, memory, and executive function, with no evidence of cognitive decline or impairment consistent with dementia. The patient's symptoms and history are more aligned with a primary psychotic disorder rather than a neurodegenerative condition like dementia."
13122476,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical presentation and history are consistent with schizoaffective disorder, not dementia. Key features include paranoia, thought disorganization, and bizarre behavior, which improved with antipsychotic medication. There is no mention of memory impairment, cognitive decline, or other hallmarks of dementia. The patient's psychiatric history and current symptoms align with a primary psychotic disorder rather than a neurodegenerative condition like dementia."
18345518,Dementia,Yes,"The patient's clinical notes indicate a history of cognitive decline, with documented concerns for progressive dementia versus depression. The patient exhibits significant short-term memory deficits, disorientation, and repetitive behavior, as noted in the neuro exam. The MOCA score of 24 (below the normal cutoff of 26) further supports cognitive impairment. Additionally, the discharge diagnosis includes ""cognitive decline,"" and the patient's mental status improved with treatment of hyponatremia, suggesting an underlying dementia exacerbated by metabolic disturbances. These findings collectively meet the criterion for dementia."
16613366,Dementia,No,"The patient has a documented history of schizoaffective disorder, which is a psychiatric condition distinct from dementia. While the patient exhibits memory deficits (e.g., not remembering why she was admitted) and confusion, these symptoms are more consistent with her schizoaffective disorder and acute psychotic episodes rather than a neurodegenerative dementia. There is no mention of progressive cognitive decline, which is a hallmark of dementia. The patient's cognitive issues appear to be episodic and related to her psychiatric condition. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
13306568,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder and multiple psychiatric admissions, but there is no mention of dementia. Cognitive assessments documented in the records (e.g., orientation, memory, calculations) are grossly intact, and there is no evidence of progressive cognitive decline or memory impairment characteristic of dementia. The patient's cognitive issues appear to be related to his psychiatric condition rather than a neurodegenerative process."
18535163,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical presentation and history are consistent with schizophrenia and alcohol intoxication, not dementia. The cognitive deficits noted (e.g., difficulty with registration, recall, and organization) are attributed to acute psychosis and intoxication, as evidenced by the patient's improvement with antipsychotic treatment. There is no mention of progressive cognitive decline, memory impairment, or other hallmarks of dementia. The discharge diagnosis is schizophrenia, further supporting the absence of dementia."
12973912,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a history of paranoid schizophrenia but do not mention dementia. The patient's mental status is consistently documented as ""clear and coherent,"" ""alert and interactive,"" and ""oriented to time, place, and person"" across multiple admissions. There are no clinical notes, cognitive assessments, or medications (e.g., cholinesterase inhibitors) suggestive of dementia. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
11376122,Dementia,No,"The patient's cognition is repeatedly documented as intact (e.g., ""CAOx3,"" linear thought process). Her psychiatric symptoms are stable and attributable to schizophrenia; there is no evidence of degenerative cognitive decline across multiple admissions."
17025500,Dementia,No,"The patient's records indicate a history of schizophrenia, polysubstance abuse, and mild to moderate intellectual disability, but there is no mention of dementia. The cognitive impairments noted are attributed to his psychiatric condition and intellectual disability rather than a neurodegenerative process like dementia. The neuropsychological evaluation results are consistent with intellectual disability, not dementia. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
18359871,Dementia,No,"The patient's mental status exam indicates disorganized and tangential thought processes, paranoia, and delusions, which are more consistent with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (paranoid type) as noted in the discharge diagnosis. There is no evidence of memory impairment (other than refusal to participate in parts of the cognitive exam), decline in cognitive function, or other hallmarks of dementia. The patient is oriented to person, place, time, and situation, and the clinical focus is on psychotic symptoms rather than neurodegenerative or cognitive decline. Thus, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
13018839,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes and mental status exams do not indicate any signs of dementia. The patient's cognitive assessment shows intact sensorium, orientation, attention, memory, and fund of knowledge. The patient's issues are primarily related to depression, delusional disorder, and psychotic features, which are distinct from dementia. There is no evidence of progressive cognitive decline or memory impairment characteristic of dementia."
19064476,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic impressions primarily indicate a chronic paranoid schizophrenia (Axis I: Chronic Paranoid Schizophrenia) and delusional parasitosis, not dementia. While the patient exhibits impaired judgment and insight, these are consistent with his psychotic disorder rather than a neurodegenerative condition like dementia. There is no mention of memory loss, cognitive decline, or other hallmark features of dementia in the patient's history or examination. The patient's refusal to perform cognitive tasks appears to be due to paranoia and lack of cooperation, not an underlying cognitive deficit. Thus, the exclusion criterion for dementia is not met."
10324612,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes and history indicate a diagnosis of unspecified psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder with psychotic features, but there is no mention of dementia. The patient's cognitive function, as noted in the neuropsychiatric examination, includes intact attention, orientation, memory, and executive function, which are not consistent with dementia. The patient's symptoms are better explained by her primary psychiatric conditions rather than a neurodegenerative disorder like dementia."
18796800,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical history includes depression, anxiety, PTSD, and migraines, but there is no mention of dementia or cognitive impairment. The discharge notes describe the patient's mental status as ""Clear and coherent"" and level of consciousness as ""Alert and interactive,"" which further supports the absence of dementia. No cognitive assessments or dementia-related symptoms are documented in the provided data."
18397082,Dementia,No,"The patient's cognitive exam shows intact orientation, memory, and fund of knowledge, with no evidence of significant cognitive decline or impairment consistent with dementia. The primary diagnoses are schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and acute mania with psychotic features, which are distinct from dementia. The patient's disorganization and tangential thought process are attributed to her psychiatric condition rather than a neurodegenerative process."
13428819,Dementia,No,"The patient's clinical notes describe symptoms consistent with a psychotic disorder (schizoaffective disorder-bipolar type) and disorganized behavior, but there is no evidence of cognitive decline or memory impairment characteristic of dementia. The patient refused parts of the cognitive exam, but the documented symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, paranoia, disorganized speech) are more indicative of a primary psychiatric condition rather than dementia. No mention of progressive cognitive deficits or neurodegenerative findings is present."
10303727,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a history of paranoid schizophrenia with visual and auditory hallucinations, as well as episodes of altered mental status (AMS) related to psychiatric medications (e.g., Seroquel, Risperdal, Ativan) and substance abuse. However, there is no documented evidence of progressive cognitive decline, memory impairment, or other hallmark features of dementia. The patient's cognitive assessment during the mental status exam showed orientation to self and place (though not fully to date), intact registration and recall, and logical thought form, which are inconsistent with a dementia diagnosis. The AMS episodes were transient and attributed to medication side effects or psychiatric exacerbations, not a neurodegenerative process. Thus, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
18751419,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records do not indicate any diagnosis or symptoms consistent with dementia. The patient has a history of depression, PTSD, and conversion disorder, but there is no evidence of cognitive decline, memory impairment, or other hallmarks of dementia. Neurological exams and mental status evaluations documented in the records do not suggest dementia."
12018196,Dementia,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a history of schizoaffective disorder, psychosis, and substance use disorder, but there is no mention of dementia. The cognitive exams documented in the records show intact orientation, memory, and other cognitive functions, which are not consistent with a diagnosis of dementia. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for dementia."
13049093,Dementia,No,"The patient's cognitive deficits are primarily attributed to his chronic psychiatric conditions (schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type) and history of anoxic brain injury, rather than dementia. His disorganization, memory issues, and impaired insight/judgment are consistent with his psychiatric diagnosis and organic brain injury. There is no mention of progressive cognitive decline or neurodegenerative features typical of dementia. The cognitive exam notes intact orientation, attention, and memory with prompting, which does not align with a dementia diagnosis."
