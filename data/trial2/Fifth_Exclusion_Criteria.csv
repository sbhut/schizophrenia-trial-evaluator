19706200,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient's history includes an attempted overdose on Klonopin and Suboxone, and she is currently prescribed Suboxone (buprenorphine-naloxone), which is used to treat opioid dependence. Additionally, the urine tox screen was positive for amphetamines, and the patient was taking Adderall (an amphetamine) at higher than prescribed doses. These findings indicate active substance abuse, meeting the exclusion criterion."
19700168,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's records indicate a history of schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions, but there is no mention of active substance abuse. The urine drug screens were negative for common substances of abuse (e.g., benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, methadone). Additionally, family history notes a sister with polysubstance abuse, but this does not indicate active substance abuse by the patient."
10884708,Active substance abuse,No,"There is no evidence in the patient's records of active substance abuse. The patient has a history of paranoid schizophrenia and has been prescribed medications like fentanyl and oxycodone for pain management related to metastatic breast cancer, but there are no indications of misuse or abuse of these or any other substances. The clinical notes do not mention any behaviors or findings suggestive of substance abuse."
15112182,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient denies recent alcohol or drug use, and the toxicology screen is negative for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, and methadone. Although there is a distant history of crack and marijuana use, there is no evidence of current or active substance abuse. The clinical notes also state ""# Substance Use: No acute or chronic issues,"" further supporting the absence of active substance abuse."
16548967,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's records include multiple urine drug screens (e.g., ""ASA-NEG Ethanol-NEG Acetmnp-NEG Bnzodzp-NEG Barbitr-NEG Tricycl-NEG"") which were negative for substances of abuse. There is no documentation of active substance abuse in the clinical notes, medications, or social history. The patient's behavioral issues are attributed to schizophrenia and dementia, not substance abuse."
18581630,Active substance abuse,No,"There is no mention of active substance abuse in any of the provided patient data. The patient has a history of schizophrenia and is on medications like clozapine, lamotrigine, and lorazepam, but there is no indication of current substance abuse in the clinical notes, social history, or discharge summaries."
18709925,Active substance abuse,Not Enough Information,"The patient's history includes medications like clonazepam and quetiapine, which are sometimes associated with substance abuse, but there is no explicit documentation of active substance abuse in the provided clinical notes. The presence of a bottle of Klonopin (clonazepam) during the GSW incident could raise suspicion, but it is not conclusive evidence of active abuse. Urine toxicology screens during admissions were negative for substances like benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, and amphetamines. Therefore, there is insufficient information to confirm active substance abuse."
14222176,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of cocaine-induced MI and alcohol abuse. In the most recent admission notes (2193-11-28), the patient reports stopping drinking 1.5 months ago, but there is no clear evidence of sustained sobriety or active treatment for substance abuse. Additionally, the patient has a pattern of non-compliance with medications and erratic behavior, which raises concerns about ongoing substance use. The clinical notes also mention ""No acute or chronic issues"" under substance abuse, but this is contradicted by the patient's history and recent behavior. Given the patient's history and lack of clear evidence of sustained recovery, active substance abuse cannot be ruled out."
11197450,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's social history explicitly states that she denies alcohol, tobacco, and illicit substance use. There is no evidence in the clinical notes or lab results (e.g., toxicology screens were negative) to suggest active substance abuse. The mention of smoking hookah in the past does not constitute current active substance abuse. Thus, the patient does not meet this exclusion criterion."
13909531,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient's most recent admission note (2117-04-01) documents active alcohol use disorder with a current relapse, including self-reported daily alcohol consumption (e.g., ""40 oz liquor of E and J 40 percent"") and lab results consistent with alcohol use (elevated AST > ALT, BAL 219 on admission). The diagnosis of ""Alcohol Use Disorder"" is explicitly listed in the discharge summary, and the patient required naltrexone treatment for alcohol cravings. This meets the definition of active substance abuse."
16093686,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient's chart explicitly states a history of polysubstance abuse, including alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. The chief complaint is ""Acute EtOH intoxication,"" and the patient was admitted for detox from alcohol. The patient reports current use of alcohol (whiskey daily) and past use of heroin and cocaine, with recent heroin use 3 months ago. The discharge diagnosis is ""alcohol intoxication,"" and the patient was monitored for alcohol withdrawal during hospitalization. These findings clearly indicate active substance abuse, meeting the exclusion criterion."
11298819,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's medical records consistently document a denial of alcohol or drug use, with the only substance use noted being cigarette smoking. There is no evidence of active substance abuse in the clinical notes, lab results, or medications. The discharge instructions also emphasize avoiding alcohol and drugs, but this appears to be general advice rather than indicative of an active issue. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for active substance abuse."
15150123,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of polysubstance abuse, including cocaine, heroin, and trazodone. Recent records indicate ongoing use of marijuana (""smokes marijuana every other day"") and past use of cocaine. Additionally, the patient has been admitted for issues related to substance use (e.g., benzodiazepine overdose, altered mental status due to polypharmacy). The clinical notes also highlight concerns about illicit drug use contributing to hospital admissions, and the patient has been counseled on abstinence. These findings confirm active substance abuse."
16191898,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's lab results (urine and blood tests) for substances such as ethanol, cocaine, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, and others were negative. Additionally, the clinical notes explicitly state ""Substance Abuse: No acute or chronic issues"" and the discharge instructions advise avoiding substance abuse without indicating any current issues. There is no evidence of active substance abuse in the provided data."
13631551,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's lab results (urine toxicology and serum tests) were negative for substances including ethanol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, tricyclics, cocaine, amphetamines, and opiates. The clinical notes do not mention any active substance abuse, and the discharge instructions specifically advise avoiding drug abuse, implying no current issue was identified. Thus, there is no evidence of active substance abuse."
19903733,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient admits to using marijuana ""rarely,"" with last use approximately one week ago, but further questioning during hospitalization revealed he was using marijuana up to three times a day in the month leading to hospitalization. This pattern of use, especially the increased frequency, qualifies as active substance abuse. Additionally, the discharge diagnosis includes ""substance-induced mood disorder,"" and the discharge instructions specifically advise avoiding drug abuse, indicating clinical concern about ongoing substance use. The urine drug screen was negative, but this does not rule out recent or intermittent use. The clinical notes and diagnosis support the conclusion of active substance abuse."
12052932,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's records include toxicology screens (e.g., ""ASA-NEG Ethanol-NEG Acetmnp-NEG Bnzodzp-NEG Barbitr-NEG Tricycl-NEG"") that are negative for substances of abuse. Additionally, there are no clinical notes indicating active substance abuse, and the patient's psychiatric history focuses on schizophrenia without mention of comorbid substance use disorders. Social history sections are largely blank but do not report substance use. Thus, there is no evidence to suggest active substance abuse."
17894568,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's social history consistently reports no alcohol or drug use other than tobacco (1 ppd). Lab results (e.g., urine drug screens and ethanol levels) were negative for substances. Clinical notes do not indicate any behaviors or findings suggestive of active substance abuse. The discharge instructions also reinforce avoidance of substance abuse, but there is no evidence of current abuse."
14560913,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's medical records include multiple admissions for psychiatric and medical conditions, but there is no documentation of active substance abuse. The social history explicitly states ""no history of alcohol abuse"" and ""no history of illicit drug use."" Additionally, discharge instructions advise avoiding substance abuse, but there is no evidence of current or recent substance abuse in the clinical notes, lab results, or medications. Thus, the patient does not meet this exclusion criterion."
19014146,Active substance abuse,Not Enough Information,"The patient's mother suspects drug use, but the patient denies it. Urine drug screening results are negative for common substances (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, methadone). However, the clinical notes do not provide conclusive evidence to confirm or rule out active substance abuse, as the suspicion remains unverified and the scope of testing may not cover all potential substances."
19076317,Active substance abuse,No,"There is no mention of active substance abuse in the patient's medical history, social history, or lab results (e.g., toxicology screens were negative for substances like benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, and oxycodone). The patient's seizures and other neurological symptoms are attributed to her history of cerebral venous thrombosis, intracranial hemorrhages, and medication noncompliance, not substance abuse."
15773641,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient explicitly denies alcohol and drug use during the first admission. Although there is a mention of positive urine opiates, there is no further indication of active substance abuse, such as behavioral patterns, withdrawal symptoms, or ongoing treatment for substance abuse. The positive urine opiates could be due to prescribed medications or other explanations, but without additional evidence, active substance abuse cannot be confirmed. The patient's history and clinical notes focus on schizophrenia and foreign body ingestion, with no mention of substance abuse issues."
14242004,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's substance abuse history indicates occasional alcohol use (2 times a month) and tobacco use (1 ppd), but there is no evidence of active illicit substance abuse. The clinical notes mention mild benzodiazepine-seeking behaviors during a prior admission, but there is no indication of current active substance abuse. The urine toxicology results were negative, further supporting the conclusion that the patient does not meet the criterion for active substance abuse."
18213938,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's medical record does not mention any history or current evidence of substance abuse. The medications listed (Celexa, Omeprazole, Docusate Sodium, Ibuprofen, and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen) are prescribed for legitimate medical conditions and post-operative pain management. There are no indications of misuse or abuse of these substances. The discharge instructions include standard precautions regarding narcotics (e.g., not driving or combining with alcohol/sedatives), but these are routine and do not imply active substance abuse. No other red flags (e.g., behavioral concerns, lab results, or clinical notes) suggest substance abuse."
11248130,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's records explicitly state ""SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY: none per patient"" in the first admission and ""Reports h/o MJ x ___ years ago, mushrooms once years ago. EtOH w/some heavy drinking, sober since ___ after seeing a police officer in a convenience store. Denies past/current IVDA. No tobacco since ___"" in the second admission. There is no evidence of current substance abuse, and the patient is documented as sober. Discharge instructions also emphasize avoiding substance abuse, further supporting the absence of active abuse."
16355814,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient's history includes marijuana use, which is documented as contributing to his anxiety and paranoia. The discharge diagnosis explicitly lists ""Marijuana use/abuse"" as a secondary diagnosis. Although the patient is noted to be committed to abstaining from marijuana at the time of discharge, the presence of recent use and its documented negative impact on his mental health qualifies as active substance abuse per the exclusion criteria."
16393838,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient reported regular daily marijuana use (""$5 bag"") and was diagnosed with ""Cannabis Use Disorder, Moderate"" at discharge. Although the urine toxicology screen was negative for other substances, the patient's self-reported marijuana use and the clinical diagnosis confirm active substance abuse."
13899324,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's medical records indicate a history of schizophrenia, self-injury (cutting and head banging), and psychiatric hospitalizations, but there is no mention of active substance abuse. The discharge instructions include a recommendation to avoid abusing alcohol and drugs, but this appears to be preventive advice rather than evidence of current substance abuse. Lab results for substances like ethanol and benzodiazepines were negative. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for active substance abuse."
12940117,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's substance use history indicates denial of current or past use of alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs. Lab results (urine toxicology and blood tests) are negative for substances like benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, and methadone. There is no clinical evidence or documentation suggesting active substance abuse. The patient's primary issues are related to schizophrenia and seizure disorder, with no indication of substance abuse complicating her condition."
11331027,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient's discharge diagnosis includes ""Polysubstance Abuse"" under Axis I, indicating a history of substance abuse. Additionally, the discharge instructions explicitly advise the patient to avoid abusing alcohol and any drugs, further supporting the presence of active substance abuse. The toxicology screen was negative for specific substances (ethanol, acetaminophen, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, tricyclics), but this does not rule out active abuse of other substances or intermittent use. The clinical context and diagnosis confirm active substance abuse."
18144278,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of alcohol abuse, including episodes of heavy binge drinking, and current use of medical marijuana. The clinical notes indicate that the patient remains in the ""precontemplative stage"" regarding alcohol use, denies having a serious drinking problem, and plans to continue drinking in moderation. This behavior, along with the documented history, meets the criterion for active substance abuse."
12892024,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient's history includes recurrent admissions related to substance abuse (e.g., opioid use disorder on Suboxone, cocaine use confirmed by UTox). The clinical notes from multiple encounters (e.g., 2170-07-28, 2170-09-25) document active substance use, including cocaine and heroin, and the patient is frequently managed with medications like methadone or Suboxone. The most recent notes (e.g., 2170-12-30) also indicate ongoing substance use concerns, including relapse risks and involvement with addiction psychiatry."
15876666,Active substance abuse,No,"There is no documentation in the patient's extensive medical history, including multiple admissions and discharge summaries, indicating active substance abuse. The patient's medications are managed by healthcare providers, and there are no mentions of substance use disorders or related behaviors in the clinical notes. The patient's conditions primarily involve schizophrenia, asthma, recurrent pneumonia, and other chronic medical issues without any evidence of substance abuse."
15725940,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient explicitly denies recent drug use, IV drug use, heroin use, and recent alcohol intake. Lab results (urine and blood tests) for substances such as ethanol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, and methadone are all negative. There is no evidence of active substance abuse in the clinical notes or lab results."
18321272,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient consistently denies alcohol and illicit drug use across multiple encounters. There is no evidence of active substance abuse in the clinical notes, lab results, or medications. The patient does report tobacco use (e-cigarettes and pipe tobacco), but this does not constitute active substance abuse as per the exclusion criteria."
19308216,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's records indicate the use of prescribed medications, including buprenorphine (Butrans) for chronic pain management, which is not indicative of active substance abuse. There is no mention of illicit drug use, alcohol abuse, or non-prescribed medication misuse in the clinical notes. Urine toxicology (Utox) was negative, further supporting the absence of active substance abuse. The patient's history includes concerns about opioid use for pain management, but this is managed under medical supervision and does not meet the criteria for active substance abuse."
15881594,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's history includes episodes of heavy alcohol consumption during specific events (e.g., draft parties), but there is no documentation of ongoing or active substance abuse. The toxicology screen (Ethanol-NEG) was negative, and there is no mention of current substance use disorder or treatment for substance abuse in the social history or discharge medications. The patient's symptoms and management are focused on seizure disorder and mood symptoms, with no evidence of active substance abuse."
13949181,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's medical records include urine and serum toxicology screens which were negative for substances of abuse. There is no documentation of active substance abuse in the clinical notes, social history, or medication lists. The patient's behavioral issues are attributed to schizophrenia and not substance abuse."

Although there is a history of marijuana use per recent PCP note, the patient denied current use, and there is no evidence of active substance abuse in the clinical notes or lab results. The discharge instructions include counseling to avoid marijuana, but this does not indicate active abuse at the time of evaluation."
14140685,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's substance abuse history indicates rare alcohol use and prescribed valium (diazepam). There is no evidence of active substance abuse in the clinical notes or lab results (urine drug screen was negative for illicit substances except for prescribed benzodiazepines). The patient's benzodiazepine use was monitored and adjusted during hospitalization, but this does not constitute active abuse."
10649223,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient consistently denies current or recent use of alcohol, marijuana, and illicit drugs across multiple encounters. Lab results (e.g., negative urine toxicology for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, oxycodone, methadone) and clinical notes corroborate this. The only substance use documented is tobacco (0.5 ppd), which does not qualify as ""active substance abuse"" per the exclusion criteria. No evidence of active abuse or dependence on other substances is present."
14513439,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's records include multiple toxicology screens (urine and blood) that were negative for substances of abuse (e.g., benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, methadone). There is no documentation of active substance abuse in the clinical notes, and the patient denies alcohol or illicit drug use.

There are no clinical findings, lab results, or behavioral observations suggesting active substance abuse. The patient's medications (e.g., valproic acid, aripiprazole) and diagnoses (schizoaffective disorder, CKD) also do not indicate substance abuse. Thus, the criterion is not met."
14156350,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's substance abuse history explicitly denies use of alcohol (no history of blackouts/withdrawal/seizures/detoxes), tobacco (non-smoker), and illicit drugs (denies MJ/LSD/Ecstasy/Mushrooms/Cocaine/Crack/Amphetamines/Opiates/Benzos).

Additionally, there is no documentation in the clinical notes suggesting active substance abuse. The patient's psychiatric symptoms are attributed to her history of psychosis and schizophrenia, not substance abuse. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for active substance abuse."
17359276,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of tobacco abuse, with records indicating ongoing use (e.g., ""continues to smoke"" and ""unwilling to quit at this time""). While tobacco is not classified as an illicit substance, it is a substance of abuse, and the patient's persistent use despite medical advice qualifies as active substance abuse under the given criterion."

The clinical notes from the psychiatric admission explicitly state ""substance use (alcohol, and amphetamines)"" and describe ongoing issues with substance abuse, including daily alcohol use. The discharge diagnosis also includes ""stimulant use disorder"" and ""alcohol use disorder,"" confirming active substance abuse. This meets the exclusion criterion."
16573137,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient denies current use of alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, benzodiazepines, LSD/PCP, and other substances. Although outside hospital records indicate a history of cannabis use disorder (smoking 2 blunts per day), there is no evidence of active cannabis use during the current admission. Urine drug screen was positive for opiates, but the patient denies opiate use, and no clinical evidence supports active abuse. The discharge summary also states ""Substance Use Disorders: None."" Thus, active substance abuse is not confirmed."
14668389,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of substance abuse, including alcohol and marijuana (MJ), as noted in the clinical notes. Specifically, the patient admitted to using substances again (""alcohol and mj"") during a period of decompensation.

12056267,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's lab results (urine and blood tests) show negative results for substances such as ethanol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, and methadone. Additionally, there is no documentation in the clinical notes suggesting active substance abuse. The discharge instructions include a general reminder to avoid abusing alcohol and drugs, but this is a standard precaution and not indicative of current abuse. Thus, the patient does not meet the criterion for active substance abuse."
11402251,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of polysubstance abuse, including heroin, crack cocaine, and alcohol, with multiple admissions for intoxication and withdrawal. Recent admissions note active use (e.g., serum EtOH 290, UDS +cocaine, and self-reported heavy alcohol intake). Clinical notes describe ongoing withdrawal symptoms requiring treatment (e.g., diazepam, phenobarbital) and repeated presentations for substance-related complications (e.g., withdrawal seizures, hypoxemia). This confirms active substance abuse."
13283535,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's medical records consistently deny active substance abuse. In the psychiatric admissions, the patient specifically denies alcohol (EtOH) and other drug use, with only a noted history of smoking 3 cigars a day. There is no evidence of current substance abuse in the clinical notes, lab results (e.g., negative ethanol and drug screens), or medications. The patient has a history of schizoaffective disorder and chronic pain but no indication of active substance abuse."
19082488,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient explicitly denies recent substance use, and both serum and urine toxicology screens (including ethanol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, tricyclics, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, methadone, and oxycodone) were negative. There is no clinical evidence or documentation suggesting active substance abuse. The patient's presentation is consistent with acute psychosis secondary to paranoid schizophrenia, not substance-induced symptoms."
15040139,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's records include toxicology screens (e.g., ethanol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, tricyclics) which were negative during hospital admissions. There is no documentation of active substance abuse in the clinical notes, social history, or lab results. The patient's psychiatric decompensations are attributed to medication non-adherence and underlying schizoaffective disorder, not substance abuse."
16914402,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's records explicitly state ""no substance abuse per pt"" in the Family History section, and there is no mention of active substance abuse in the social history, clinical notes, or lab results (e.g., toxicology screens were negative for substances like ethanol, benzodiazepines, etc.). The patient's behavioral and medical issues are attributed to psychiatric and neurological conditions, not substance abuse."
13333091,Active substance abuse,Not Enough Information,"The patient's medical record includes a history of bipolar and chronic schizoaffective disorder, which are risk factors for substance abuse, but there is no explicit mention of active substance abuse in the social history, clinical notes, or medications (e.g., no medications like buprenorphine or naloxone, or documented withdrawal symptoms). The discharge instructions caution against alcohol use with narcotics, but this is a standard warning and does not confirm active abuse. Without further documentation (e.g., positive drug screens, clinician notes on abuse), the information is insufficient to determine if this criterion is met."
17816095,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient explicitly denies drug or alcohol abuse in the psychiatric review of systems and social history. There is no evidence in the clinical notes, lab results, or medications to suggest active substance abuse. The patient's presentation is consistent with decompensated psychosis and medication noncompliance, but not substance abuse."
13122476,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient denies ingesting any drugs or alcohol, and the urine toxicology screen results are negative for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, methadone, and other substances. There is no other evidence in the clinical notes to suggest active substance abuse. Therefore, the patient does not meet this exclusion criterion."
18345518,Active substance abuse,Not Enough Information,"The patient's social history mentions that she ""socially drinks alcohol"" and had a drink several weeks prior to admission, with a sister reporting a history of heavy alcohol drinking until a few years ago. However, there is no explicit documentation of current active substance abuse (e.g., illicit drugs, prescription misuse, or ongoing alcohol dependence). The urine drug screen was negative for common substances (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, oxycodone, methadone), but this does not rule out all forms of substance abuse. Without clearer evidence of current, active abuse, the determination cannot be made definitively."
16613366,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's urine drug screen was negative for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, and methadone. There is no documentation of active substance abuse in the clinical notes or social history. The patient's psychiatric medications (e.g., Seroquel, Haldol, Ativan) are prescribed for schizoaffective disorder and are not indicative of substance abuse. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criterion for active substance abuse."
13306568,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's records mention a history of substance abuse in adolescence (speed, cocaine, LSD, mescaline) but no recent or current substance use is documented. Urine drug screens in multiple encounters are negative for substances like benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, and methadone (e.g., 2128-03-26, 2131-08-10, 2135-07-03). The patient is not described as currently engaging in substance abuse, lacks behavioral or clinical signs of active abuse, and there is no mention of recent treatment for substance use disorder."
18535163,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient's history and clinical notes indicate active alcohol use, including admission to intoxication (""drunk"") and inconsistent reporting of alcohol consumption. Lab results confirm ethanol presence (ETHANOL-29). Additionally, the discharge diagnosis includes ""EtOH use disorder,"" and the patient was placed on a protocol for alcohol withdrawal, further supporting active substance abuse."
12973912,Active substance abuse,No,"There is no mention of active substance abuse in any of the provided patient data. The patient's medical history includes conditions like paranoid schizophrenia, dysphagia, and recurrent UTIs, but there are no references to substance abuse, illicit drug use, or related behaviors in the clinical notes, social history, or medications. The absence of such documentation supports the conclusion that the patient does not meet this exclusion criterion."
11376122,Active substance abuse,No,Comprehensive review of records confirms no evidence of active substance abuse; historical use is remote and explicitly discontinued.
17025500,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of polysubstance abuse, including etoh, heroin, cocaine, and hallucinogens, as noted in the ""Social History"" and ""History of Present Illness"" sections. During the most recent admission (2168-05-12), the patient reported daily alcohol and marijuana use, biweekly heroin use, and monthly cocaine use, along with recent use of ecstasy and ""purple haze."" Despite negative toxicology results at the time of admission, the patient's self-reported behavior and clinical notes confirm ongoing active substance abuse. This is further supported by the discharge diagnosis, which includes alcohol dependence, marijuana abuse, and polysubstance abuse (opiate, cocaine, and ecstasy). Thus, the patient meets the criterion for active substance abuse."
18359871,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient explicitly denies current use of substances such as alcohol (only a ""very small"" amount of wine every few months), tobacco (nonsmoker), and illicit drugs (MJ/LSD/Ecstasy/Mushrooms/Cocaine/Crack/Amphetamines). Lab results (urine and blood tests) also confirm the absence of substances like ethanol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, and amphetamines. The patient's social history includes teaching kids not to do drugs, further supporting the lack of active substance abuse. There is no evidence in the clinical notes or lab results to suggest otherwise."
13018839,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's urine drug screen results (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, methadone) were negative, and there is no documentation in the clinical notes or history suggesting active substance abuse. The patient's psychiatric symptoms are attributed to her diagnosed conditions (e.g., delusional disorder, bipolar disorder with psychotic features) and not to substance use."
19064476,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's urine toxicology (Utox) was negative, and there is no mention of substance abuse in the clinical notes, social history, or collateral reports. The patient's presentation is consistent with a chronic psychotic disorder (delusional parasitosis/paranoid schizophrenia) rather than substance-induced symptoms. Thus, there is no evidence to support active substance abuse."
10324612,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient's mother reported a history of cannabis use, and the patient has a documented history of alcohol use disorder. Although the patient currently denies substance use, collateral information from family members indicates ongoing cannabis use, which is concerning in the setting of her psychotic episodes. This meets the criterion for active substance abuse."
18796800,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient has a history of narcotic abuse but is noted to have been ""previously enrolled in ___"" (likely a treatment program), and there is no mention of current substance abuse in the social history, clinical notes, or discharge medications. The patient is prescribed Oxycodone and Clonazepam PRN, but these are for chronic conditions (back pain and anxiety) with no indication of misuse or active abuse. Thus, the patient does not meet the criterion for active substance abuse."
18397082,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's lab results (urine and serum toxicology) were negative for substances including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, and methadone. There is no documentation in the clinical notes suggesting active substance abuse. The patient's behavioral issues are attributed to schizoaffective disorder and mania, not substance use."
13428819,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's urine toxicology screen was negative for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opioids, cocaine, amphetamines, and methadone. Although there is a mention of a previous visit for cocaine use, there is no evidence of current active substance abuse in the provided data. The clinical notes and lab results do not indicate ongoing substance abuse."
10303727,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of polysubstance abuse, including crack cocaine and alcohol. In the most recent admission, the patient reported smoking $20 worth of crack cocaine the day before admission, indicating active substance abuse. Additionally, the patient's social history includes heavy alcohol use and prior IV drug use, further supporting the presence of active substance abuse. The discharge diagnosis also lists alcohol dependence and polysubstance abuse, confirming the ongoing issue."
18751419,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient has a documented history of opioid dependence and is currently on methadone maintenance therapy. There are multiple instances in the records where the patient has tested positive for substances not prescribed to him (e.g., benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates) despite denying illicit drug use. Additionally, there are notes indicating the patient has been dishonest about his substance use and has a history of relapsing with prescription medications like oxycodone. These findings strongly suggest active substance abuse."
12018196,Active substance abuse,Yes,"The patient admits to daily marijuana use and recent alcohol consumption (""drinking brandy""). His manic symptoms and behavioral disturbances are consistent with active substance abuse, as corroborated by collateral information from his psychiatrist."
13049093,Active substance abuse,No,"The patient's urine and serum toxicology screens were negative for substances of abuse (e.g., cocaine, opiates, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, etc.). Additionally, the patient denied current substance use, and there was no collateral information suggesting active substance abuse during the periods documented. The patient's history mentions past marijuana use but no recent or active abuse. Thus, there is no evidence to support active substance abuse."
